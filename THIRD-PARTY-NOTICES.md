## Not included

The unit tests use doctest (https://github.com/doctest/doctest, MIT License);
it is not part of the released executables. The NVIDIA libraries the app calls
(`nvapi64.dll`, `nvml.dll`) and Direct3D come with the graphics driver and
Windows; the app loads them at run time and ships none of their code.
